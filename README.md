# Class-Data-Loader
Use python to automatically transcribe an image of a table with handwritten numbers and output as a csv file.
Useful for digitizing handwritten tables (note: be careful with table headers, as this script *__only transcribes numbers__*)

## TODO: 
Port https://github.com/Las-re/digit-recognition script (for actual image recognition)
* Limit Input Directory to *Cropped* images
* Output to a separate directory as .csv or .md or other

Port https://github.com/KananVyas/BoxDetection script (for isolating individual cells)
* remove unnecessary image saving
* Merge with __digit-recognition__ for single-command execution
* add a script to cleanse all folders (to avoid buildup)

###Personal
* https://datatofish.com/batch-python-script/ use to automate running. Link to web-scraper?
